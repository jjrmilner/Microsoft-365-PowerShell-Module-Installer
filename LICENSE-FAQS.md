### FAQ: MSP and Consulting Use

**Q: Can an MSP or consultant use this tool in a paid engagement?**  
**A:** It depends on how the tool is used:  
- **Allowed:** If the tool is used internally by the end customer (e.g., installed in their tenant) and the consultant is simply assisting, this is generally acceptable.  
- **Not allowed without a commercial licence:** If the MSP or consultant provides a managed service where the tool runs in their own environment (e.g., their tenant or infrastructure) or if the value of the service substantially derives from the tool‚Äôs functionality, this falls under the definition of ‚ÄúSell‚Äù in the Commons Clause and requires a commercial licence.

**Q: Why is this restricted?**  
The Commons Clause removes the right to ‚ÄúSell,‚Äù which includes providing a service for a fee where the value derives from the software. This ensures fair use and prevents competitors from monetising the tool without contributing back.
